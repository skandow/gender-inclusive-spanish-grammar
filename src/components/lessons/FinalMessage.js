            <p>At this point, you have now learned every aspect of Spanish language grammar that is unique to the concepts of 
              non-binary Spanish. From here, you can explore other sites to continue your knowledge and development in both 
              vocabulary and other grammar areas.</p>  
            <p>If you need recommendations of topics to explore, consider the following:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>The Spanish language has multiple ways of discussing events in the past, the two primary being verb tenses 
                    known as the <strong>preterite</strong> and <strong>imperfect</strong>. How to construct these tenses and the 
                    differences between them are items worth knowing.
                </li>
                <li>There is also a future verb tense.</li>
                <li>The <strong>subjunctive</strong> mood was mentioned in a previous lesson. This mood is one that is often 
                    confusing to grasp for native English speakers. In addition, almost all of the verb tenses used in the indicative 
                    mood have a corresponding form in the subjunctive mood.
                </li>
                <li>There were numerous prepositions and conjunctions that are worth exploring.</li>
                <li>Consider also exploring the comparative and superlative forms of adjectives as well as how to form adverbs 
                    from adjectives.
                </li>
                <li>We briefly touched on the negative in Spanish. You'll want to further explore words that have negative connotation in Spanish.</li>
            </ul>  
            <p>At this point, you should be aware of pronouns you can ask others to utilize when referring to you:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Subject Pronoun/Prepositional Pronoun: <span style={{border: "1px solid black", padding: "3px"}}>{subjectPronoun}</span> </li>
                <li>Direct Object Pronoun: <span style={{border: "1px solid black", padding: "3px"}}>{directObjectPronoun}</span></li>
                <li>Demonstrative Adjective/Pronoun (near): <span style={{border: "1px solid black", padding: "3px"}}>{demonstrativePronounNear}</span></li>
                <li>Demonstrative Adjective/Pronoun (far): <span style={{border: "1px solid black", padding: "3px"}}>{demonstrativePronounFar}</span></li>
                <li>Demonstrative Adjective/Pronoun (very far): <span style={{border: "1px solid black", padding: "3px"}}>{demonstrativePronounVeryFar}</span></li>
            </ul>
